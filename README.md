This project is a simple Counter Timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a number (in seconds), start a countdown, and see the timer update in real time.

Project Files:

- index.html         : The main HTML structure of the page
- styles70.css       : External CSS file for styling the timer
- script20.js        : JavaScript file containing the timer logic
- README.md          : This documentation file

Features:

- Simple and clean timer interface
- Real-time countdown in MM:SS format
- Input validation for non-numeric or negative values
- "Set Timer" to start countdown
- "Reset Timer" to stop and clear timer

Technologies Used:

- HTML for structure

How to Use This Project:

1. Download all the files: minijava.html, styles70.css, and script20.js.
2. Make sure all three files are in the same folder/directory.
3. Open the index.html file using any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4. You will see a heading "Counter Timer" and an input box.
5. Enter a time in seconds (e.g., 60 for 1 minute).
6. Click on the "Set Timer" button to start the countdown.
7. The time will display in the format MM:SS and will update every second.
8. Once the timer hits zero, an alert will show "Time is up!"
9. To stop and reset the timer, click the "Reset Timer" button. This will also clear the input.

Example:

- Input: 90
- Output on screen: 01:30 → 01:29 → 01:28 ... down to 00:00
- Alert: "Time is up!"
