How to Use This Project:

1. Download all the files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
2. Make sure all three files are in the same folder/directory.
3. Open the index.html file using any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4. You will see a heading "Counter Timer" and an input box.
5. Enter a time in seconds (e.g., 60 for 1 minute).
6. Click on the "Set Timer" button to start the countdown.
7. The time will display in the format MM:SS and will update every second.
8. Once the timer hits zero, an alert will show "Time is up!"
9. To stop and reset the timer, click the "Reset Timer" button. This will also clear the input.

- Input: 90
- Output on screen: 01:30 → 01:29 → 01:28 ... down to 00:00
